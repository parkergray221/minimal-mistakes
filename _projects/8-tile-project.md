This project was completed in my last year of school as the final project for the semester in my Artificial Intelligence class. Coded in Python exclusively, this project implements the classic eight tile puzzle and solves it using several common search algorithms (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search). The goal of the program is to compare the efficiency of each algorithm solving any particular puzzle- how long does each algorithm take computationally and how many nodes of the search tree are expanded per algorithm? 

I wrote much of the back end work and wrote all of the documentation. You can find a link to the project [here](https://github.com/parkergray221/Coursework/tree/master/CSC%20665%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence/EightTileAI) .
