Done in my Software Development class, this project takes an input source code containing java byte codes, tokenizes the source file, logs the bytecodes to be performed, and performs them on a virtual machine. Though appearing as a rather daunting class, much of the program was done for us students beforehand, though the bulk of the hard work was ours to do.

Being a solo project, I wrote everything alone. You can find a link to the project [here](https://github.com/parkergray221/Coursework/tree/master/CSC%20413%20-%20Software%20Development). It contains a working jar file you can run from command prompt if you would like.
